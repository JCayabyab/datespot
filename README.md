# datespot by Jofred Cayabyab
This is the source code for the web app **datespot**, which is designed to be a simple app that recommends local date spots for users.

- This project was built with a React + Redux front end that interacts with the Google Maps Javascript API, most notably the Places and Directions libraries.
- It was built fully by me, Jofred Cayabyab, in November 2018.
- A live example can be found [here]().
