# datespot by Jofred Cayabyab
This is the source code for the web app **datespot**, which is designed to be a simple app that recommends local date spots for users.

- This project was built with a React + Redux front end that interacts with the Google Maps Javascript API, most notably the Places and Directions libraries.
- It was built fully by me, Jofred Cayabyab, in November 2018.
- A live example can be found [here]().

- Note that the `index.html` file is missing in this repo since I have included a script file with an API key. A dummy `index.html` file can be found [here](http://s000.tinyupload.com/download.php?file_id=55462562042282817864&t=5546256204228281786474350).
